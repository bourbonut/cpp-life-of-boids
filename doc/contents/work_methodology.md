## II.  Work methodology

Here are the methods we used to make our teamwork more effective :
- **Agile methods** : An agile project is organized in iterative and incremental development cycles, in which the end customer and the user are integrated and actively participate.
- **Scrum methods** : Scrum is an Agile methodology and provides a project management framework with roles, meetings and an iterative development cycle. The advantage of working in a Scrum framework is that this methodology is simple, transparent and pragmatic.


To summarize, the content of an iteration (or "scrum sprint") is defined in terms of functionalities, which are developed and then are validated at the end of the sprint. An assessment of the sprint is made before continuing with the next sprint :
- **Sprints** : A Sprint is an iteration, it is a period generally between 2 and 3 days maximum during which a finished and usable version of the product is realized. A new Sprint starts at the end of the previous one. Each Sprint has an objective and a list of features to achieve.
- **Stand-up meetings** : This is a very important 15 minute daily meeting. It is done standing up in order to avoid dragging on and to remain agile. The purpose of this meeting is to review the daily progress of the sprint. It allows the whole team to synchronize its activities and to make a plan for the next 24 hours. This meeting takes place every day, at the same time and place.
- **Gitlab Issues** : Throughout the sprint, issues go through different stages, and these stages are usually presented as columns in an Agile board. In GitLab, the Issue Board has helped us define our stages. During daily standups, the team looks at the board together, to see the status of the sprint from a workflow perspective.
- **Pair programming** : The peer programming method is mostly used for agile software development.

Two people work simultaneously on the code, one writes the code while the other checks it in real time.
