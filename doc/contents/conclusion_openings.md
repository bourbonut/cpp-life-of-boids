# VI.   Limits and ameliorations

Theses are the next amelioration we aim for our project :
- Global performance ([KDTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) algorithm to compute neighbors)
- More user configuration
- Dynamic informations on screen (add relaxation for laws, speed, etc...)
- More class independance (mainly on OpenGL)
- More code covered in the tests
